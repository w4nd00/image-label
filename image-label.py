## TODO for Wando
# - Run through the code and make sure you understand what it does
#   - leave comments anywhere you can't work out! We will go through them
# - Rename any variables we named too vaguely the first time around. This is a subjective
#   matter, so just use your own judgement here
# - [NEW FEATURE] Implement a way to detect images that have already been labelled, and
#   skip them. i.e. only label images you haven't labelled yet
#   - With this feature, you will be able to continually add new photos to your dataset
#     and not have to re-label all the old ones
#   - We will break this down into more bite-sized chunks:

## TODO for Wando + Hamish
# - Segment this program into distinct groups using functions or comment blocks
# - Read files using `with ...`
# - Add a command-line interface
# - Set up a new git feature branch for Wando to dev on
#   - We will use pull-requests and be all proper about it


# "contents" is a bit vague, something more descriptive would be better.
#
# I at least partialy named this variable iirc, sorry to make you do it again :P
#
# When choosing variable names, think about what will make the most sense when you come
# back to this code to edit it later on. Trust me...
#
# e.g. pictureDirectoryContents or picture_directory_contents, whatever you prefer
#                                                                   (just be consistent)
#
# You may feel some of the other variables could be better named too, so have a look at
# all the variables in this program and apply the above thought process. Your future self
# will thank you
